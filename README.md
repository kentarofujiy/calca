## How to use backend

* Download the project file from the download link provided above
* Import the database file “products.sql” into MySQL database
* Add your database settings to the file “config.php”
* put the "api"-files in designated directory under htdocs (of XAMPP)

## How to use frontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Run `npm start` for the usage with a proxy.conf to overcome the cross-site request when developing, it starts `ng serve` as well.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
